"""THE TIME FIELD: local time velocity as a scalar potential on a graph.

Not an engine feature. Nothing here knows what an engine is. This is the
form the dt system needs in order to be time-velocity aware, staged here
so it can be exercised against a real machine graph before it moves into
`src/common/dt_system`, which is universal and serves every sim.

WHAT IT IS

Every node carries a local time velocity: the rate its own clock runs
relative to a reference. The reference is a gauge choice -- "realtime",
or whatever cap we set -- and the ABSOLUTE LEVEL IS UNOBSERVABLE. Inside
a zone every law is already written against that zone's own clock, so
the physics is internally exact and nothing needs to know its own rate.
Time drops out.

It does not drop out in three places, and they are the whole reason this
module exists:

  1. crossing a boundary -- a product sampled in one zone and read in
     another must be resampled, which needs the rate it was sampled at
  2. comparing across zones -- dyno figures, a parity check against a
     compiled core, anything scored; both lie silently otherwise
  3. WHEN THE RATE IS CHANGING

STORED AS A LOG, AND WITH ITS DERIVATIVE

The field is `log_tau` per node. A joint's time ratio is then a
DIFFERENCE across it, and any difference field has zero circulation
around a closed loop -- so cycle consistency is structural rather than
solved. (Measured on a real machine graph: 306 nodes, 259 coupling
edges, 57 components, 10 independent cycles. Not a tree. The constraint
is real; this formulation is what makes it vanish.)

`dlog_tau_dt` is carried alongside, and it is the one with physical
consequences. A CONSTANT time gradient is unobservable -- an ideal
differential passes it losslessly, forever, felt by nobody. A CHANGING
one is a force: the adaptor's own freedom must accelerate, which takes
torque. The field is therefore dynamical, like position and velocity,
not a static map.

WHAT CAN CARRY A GRADIENT

Not a flag we invent -- a property of the mechanism. A joint can carry a
sustained time gradient if and only if it has a RATE-DIFFERENCE DEGREE
OF FREEDOM. A differential has one (the spiders). A slipping clutch has
one. A converter has one (fluid slip). A rigid shaft, a splined hub or a
gear mesh does not, and across one of those a rate mismatch accumulates
twist without bound: stall, then shatter. That is not a rule imposed
from outside, it is the same equation at infinite stiffness, and it is
what bounds the field PHYSICALLY instead of by a tuning constant.

Phase is a separate question from rate. A differential absorbs rate
difference but lets accumulated angle drift without limit -- correct for
wheels, catastrophic for a timing drive. So a phase-locked joint admits
no gradient at ANY stiffness, which is why an engine's crank, cams and
valvetrain are necessarily one zone and the boundary is at the coupling.

WE CHOOSE WHAT STORES TIME FORCE

The transient reaction from `dlog_tau_dt` has to go somewhere, and that
is a design choice rather than a fact -- see `TimeForceStore`. Whatever
we pick sets the ramp limit, because the store's inertia is what decides
how fast the field may legally change. Load shedding must RAMP, and how
fast it may ramp is a property of the machine, not of the scheduler.
Slamming the time field is dumping the clutch.

                     both outputs, carrier torque 2T, omega_c the mean:
